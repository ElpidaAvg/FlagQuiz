# 🇪🇺 Flags Guessing Game (Python Turtle)

A simple and fun educational game built with Python's Turtle module. It displays flags of different European countries, and the player must guess which country each flag belongs to.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The game randomly displays a flag drawn using turtle graphics.
- The player types the country name (in lowercase, e.g. `austria`, `germany`, etc.).
- For each correct guess, the player earns a point.
- For each wrong guess, the player loses one life.
- The game ends when the player runs out of lives or guesses all flags correctly.

## 🏁 Flags Included

- Austria
- Belgium
- Estonia
- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Poland
- Sweden
- Greece
- Netherlands

## 🧠 How It Works

Each flag is a Python function that draws it using turtle commands. The game randomly chooses a flag, displays it, and waits for user input. Correct answers increase the score; wrong ones reduce lives.

## ▶️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## 🚀 Running the Game

```bash
python flags_game.py
```

## 📁 File Structure

- `flags_game.py`: Main Python file with all the flag functions and game logic.
